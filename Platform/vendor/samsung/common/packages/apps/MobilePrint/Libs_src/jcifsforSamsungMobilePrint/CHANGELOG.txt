	- Applied jcifs_1.3.14-printing.patch icluded in the patches folder in JCIFS library.
	   http://jcifs.samba.org/src/patches/jcifs_1.3.14-printing.patch
                   - Modified printing patch to  adapt to take data from byte buffer instead of input stream.
	- Modified files after printing patch
		- SMBFile.java . Added function 
		    public int writePrintData(byte[] buffer, int length) 
	
	This change will allow to send data to shared printer. 
	Prints contents of the given inputstream / byte buffer  to this printer. This method
	does not check if the input stream / byte buffer contains content that the printer will
	understand, e.g. user may send PCL content to a PostScript printer, and
	this method would not report an error. Since this method is sychronized,
	one must create different instances of SmbFile to send print jobs in
	parallel to the same printer multiple times. This approach is slow, but
	this method is a first step to a proper printer queue implementation in
	SmbFile.



Steps to build
1. Download JCIFS library from http://jcifs.samba.org/src/
2. Patch the downloaded library with the given patch
    a.  Extract JCIFS to a folder.   for example c:/MyCode/jcifs_1.3.15
    b. Put patch file in the same folder.  for example 
                   c:/MyCode/jcifs_1.3.15_SamsungPrint.patch
    c. On Unix or on Cygwin type following command from the folder containing patch
	$ patch -p0 -l -i jcifs_1.3.15_SamsungPrint.patch
3. Now your downloaded JCIFS code is updated.
4. Can be used as source code and included in your project or can be made as JAR.
5. To make .jar follow README.txt and use build.xml.    For Ex. 
                 c:/MyCode/jcifs_1.3.15/ant JAR
 will build the library in .JAR


Note: Given patch is tested only on JCIFS_1.3.15 version only.
